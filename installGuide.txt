Laue-Script Installation Guide

Windows

Step 1: Install GitShell

Step 2: Start GitShell and download the Laue-Script files with 
	git clone https://github.com/JLuebben/Laue-Script /some/local/path/

Step 3: Navigate to /some/local/path/lauescript/data and unpack the file database.zip so that the
compressed file is located in /some/local/path/lauescript/data/

Step 4: Setup enviroment variables. To make sure Python knows where the Laue-Script files are located /some/local/path/ must be added to your operating system's enviroment variables.

Step 5: Test if everything works by opening a Python console and type 'import lauescript'.

Step 6: You might miss some dependencies. Make sure that the folowing packages are installed:
	numpy
	scipy
	sk-learn
	networkX


Linux

Do the same steps as in the Windows description except installing GitShell. Any shell will do the trick.
